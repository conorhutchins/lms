API-Football Capabilities and Limitations for a Football App
Fixtures and Results Data üìÖ‚öΩ
Match Schedules: API-Football provides comprehensive fixture data, including each match‚Äôs date and kickoff time (with timezone), the competing teams, and venue details‚Äã
COMMUNITY.KODULAR.IO
. For example, a fixture object includes fields like "date": "2020-02-06T14:00:00+00:00" and a designated timezone, ensuring you know exactly when and where a match is scheduled‚Äã
COMMUNITY.KODULAR.IO
. Home/Away Teams: Each fixture lists the home and away team with their IDs, names, and even team logos. In the JSON response, teams are nested under teams.home and teams.away ‚Äì for instance, you might see "home": {"id": 33, "name": "Manchester United", ... "logo": "https://media.api-sports.io/football/teams/33.png"}‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. This provides the team‚Äôs unique ID and a URL to its logo image, which is great for displaying team badges in your app. (Team codes and home venues are also available via the Teams endpoint if needed‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
.) Live Status Updates: Every fixture includes a status indicating its state ‚Äì e.g. Not Started, 1st Half, Halftime, 2nd Half, Finished, Postponed, etc. The API returns both a short code and a descriptive status. For example, a live fixture might show "status": {"long": "Halftime", "short": "HT", "elapsed": 45} when at halftime‚Äã
COMMUNITY.KODULAR.IO
. Common status short codes include NS (Not Started), 1H/2H (First/Second Half in progress), HT (Halftime), FT (Full Time finished), AET (After Extra Time), PEN (Penalty shootout), PST (Postponed), CANC (Canceled), etc. This allows your app to display whether a match is upcoming, live, completed, or postponed. Scores and Outcomes: API-Football provides real-time scores and full-time results. During a match, you get the current goal counts (e.g. "goals": {"home": 0, "away": 1} for a 0-1 scoreline)‚Äã
COMMUNITY.KODULAR.IO
. Once finished, the final score is recorded under score.fulltime and the status changes to FT. The API also flags the winner: each team entry has a winner boolean or null, indicating which side won or if it was a draw. For example, if the away team won, the response would show "home": {... "winner": false}, "away": {... "winner": true}‚Äã
COMMUNITY.KODULAR.IO
. This makes it easy to determine match outcomes (win/lose/draw) without manual calculation. In summary, all essential fixture info ‚Äì date/time, teams, status, and scores ‚Äì is fully supported by API-Football, which is crucial for populating your app‚Äôs fixtures and results tables.
Round Structure and ‚ÄúGameweeks‚Äù üóìÔ∏è
League Rounds: API-Football understands seasonal round structures (often equivalent to gameweeks). For example, the English Premier League has 38 rounds in a season‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
, and the API reflects this. There is a dedicated Rounds endpoint that returns all rounds (matchdays) for a given league and season‚Äã
EDUCATIVE.IO
. Each round is typically named (e.g. "Regular Season - Round 5" or "Matchday 5"). You can retrieve the list of round names using GET /fixtures/rounds?league={LEAGUE_ID}&season={YEAR}‚Äã
EDUCATIVE.IO
. In the case of Premier League (league ID 39), calling this for season 2024 would return all rounds "Round 1" through "Round 38". This ensures you can map fixtures to their respective gameweek or round in your rounds table. Fetching Fixtures by Round: The rounds data can be used to query fixtures round-by-round. The Fixtures endpoint accepts a round parameter, so you can request all matches in a specific round (e.g. league=39, season=2024, round="Regular Season - 5"). This is useful if your app shows fixtures or results per gameweek. The API documentation confirms you can get current or specific round fixtures by adding the round value in the query‚Äã
RAPIDAPI.COM
. In practice, you would first get the round names via the Rounds endpoint, then use those to fetch fixtures for each round as needed. Deadlines: Important: API-Football does not explicitly provide ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù timestamps for rounds (i.e. the cut-off time for player picks). This concept is usually external to raw match data. However, you can derive a gameweek deadline by using the fixture times: for example, the deadline for a round could be the kickoff time of the first match in that round. Since you have all fixture dates, your app‚Äôs backend can compute the round deadline by finding the earliest fixture start time in each round and perhaps subtracting a few minutes if needed. In summary, round structure is supported (you can list rounds and group fixtures by round), but ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù is something you‚Äôll implement on top ‚Äì the API provides the schedule info you need to calculate it.
Team and Competition Data üèüÔ∏è
Competitions: The API offers detailed info on leagues and cups (competitions). You can query all leagues or a specific league by country or ID. For example, Premier League can be retrieved by its league ID (39) via the Leagues endpoint‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. League data includes the league name, country, and possibly a league logo/flag if available‚Äã
COMMUNITY.KODULAR.IO
. This will help populate your app‚Äôs competitions table (e.g. league name, season, country). All major competitions (EPL, UEFA Champions League, etc.) have unique IDs and are covered by the API. Teams: Similarly, the Teams endpoint provides detailed team information. You can get teams by league and season (e.g. /teams?league=39&season=2024 for all 20 Premier League teams‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
). The response includes each team‚Äôs ID, name, code (short name), country, foundation year, and logo URL‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. It even provides the team‚Äôs home venue info (stadium name, city, capacity, etc.)‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. In fixtures data, teams are also embedded with ID, name, and logo as shown earlier. This means for your teams table in Supabase, you can populate it either by bulk fetching all teams in a league or by extracting team info from fixtures. Linking Teams to Leagues: Because you query teams per league & season, you inherently know each team‚Äôs competition. Your app‚Äôs schema might have a relationship between teams and competitions ‚Äì this is straightforward since the API returns teams in context (you‚Äôll call it for each competition you care about). Team logos are provided as direct image URLs, which you can store or use on the fly. All in all, team data is well-supported: you get unique team IDs (consistent across seasons), official names, and images, which covers everything needed for team profiles in the app.
Historical Data and Live Updates üìñüìä
Past Seasons: One of API-Football‚Äôs strengths is its historical database. They boast ‚Äúseveral years of data available‚Äù, which is ideal for statistics or fantasy apps‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. For major leagues like the Premier League, you can retrieve past seasons‚Äô fixtures, results, and standings (typically by specifying the season year). If you need to show previous results or run stats, the API can supply data from past years. Note: The free plan limits access to historical seasons (only recent seasons are available on free)‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. With a paid plan, you can query older seasons freely. In short, historical match data is supported (for example, you can get all Premier League 2021 results if your plan allows), which is helpful if your app needs to show records or if users make predictions based on past games. Live Scores: API-Football provides live score updates and in-game events in real time. In fact, all plans (including free) include a livescore feature with updates as fast as every 15 seconds‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. You can use the Livescore endpoint to get all ongoing matches‚Äô scores, or query specific fixtures at intervals. This means your app could display live results or automatically update a match‚Äôs status. If you only need scores and final results, the basic fixture info (goals and status) is often sufficient. For more granular live data, the API also offers events (goals, cards, etc.) and player stats endpoints. However, those are optional if your app doesn‚Äôt need play-by-play details. The key point is that live updates are available ‚Äì you can reliably get real-time scores for ongoing matches. (Keep in mind, implementing live updates will consume API calls; you might poll the API periodically or use a push mechanism if provided.) Coverage Depth: For major leagues, API-Football typically provides full coverage: live updates, line-ups, events, and detailed stats. For example, Premier League matches will have live minute-by-minute data. One minor limitation to note is that not all competitions have live play-by-play. Some lower-tier leagues might only update the final score (no intermediate updates). In those cases, a match‚Äôs status might stay ‚ÄúNS‚Äù (Not Started) until it finishes, then jump to the final result‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. This mainly affects obscure leagues; the Premier League and other top competitions are fully covered with live scoring. So for your use (which presumably focuses on major leagues), there should be no gaps in data availability during matches. Data Completeness: API-Football covers 1,100+ leagues and cups worldwide‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
, which includes all major European leagues, international tournaments, and many minor competitions. Premier League data is comprehensive ‚Äì from fixtures to results, and from team info to player stats. You shouldn‚Äôt encounter missing fixtures or scores for any official matches in these covered leagues. The only potential ‚Äúgaps‚Äù could be if matches are rescheduled or postponed: the API will mark those appropriately (e.g., status PST for postponed, and it will update the fixture date once rescheduled). Also, if a fixture‚Äôs date or time hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet, it might show a placeholder date or a status like TBD (to be determined)‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. But once schedules are confirmed, the data updates accordingly. In summary, for Premier League and similar leagues, coverage is robust with no significant gaps ‚Äì you‚Äôll have all fixtures and results, with the above caveats on live detail for smaller leagues and tentative scheduling.
Rate Limits and Pricing üí∞üìà
When integrating API-Football, it‚Äôs crucial to consider API call limits and costs, as they affect whether you cache data (Option A) or fetch live on demand (Option B). The service offers multiple plans:
Free Plan: 100 requests per day are allowed at no cost‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. The free tier gives access to all core endpoints (fixtures, teams, standings, etc.) for all competitions, which is great for testing and small-scale usage. However, the free plan restricts historical data ‚Äì you might only get the current season or one season back for each league‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. All live data is included, but with only 100 calls/day you must be careful not to exceed the limit (e.g. you could fetch live scores for a couple of matches periodically, but you couldn‚Äôt update dozens of games every minute).
Pro Plan ($19/month): 7,500 requests per day‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. This plan is much more generous and is usually sufficient for a moderate app user base. With 7.5k calls/day, you can update many matches frequently or pre-load lots of data. The Pro tier includes full historical seasons and all leagues. If your app grows, this is often the starting point for paid usage.
Ultra Plan ($29/month): 75,000 requests per day‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. This is for high-volume needs ‚Äì likely more than you‚Äôd need unless you have a very large user base or are making heavy real-time updates (for example, live updating scores of all global matches around the clock).
Mega Plan ($39/month): 150,000 requests per day‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. Essentially the top-tier for very large-scale applications or many simultaneous users.
All paid plans remove the season restriction and give access to the entire dataset. They differ only in the number of API calls allowed per day (as listed above)‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. Also, note that API-Football can be accessed either via their own dashboard or through RapidAPI; either way, the limits apply similarly. There don‚Äôt appear to be strict ‚Äúper minute‚Äù rate limits documented, but there is a daily quota as above. If you exceed the daily allotment on your plan, further calls might be blocked or incur charges, so plan according to your expected call volume. For feasibility: If you plan to only support one league (like EPL) and update scores maybe a few times a day (or once every 15 minutes for live matches), the free 100/day might suffice during development. But for production, especially if you have multiple competitions or many users refreshing, you‚Äôll likely need Pro or higher. The good news is the cost is relatively low at the Pro tier for the amount of data provided. In summary, consider caching data (or using Supabase to store results) to stay within call limits, and be prepared to upgrade from free if your usage grows. The API‚Äôs pricing is flexible enough to scale with your app‚Äôs popularity.
Option A (Storing Data) vs Option B (Live Fetching) üîÑ
Finally, let‚Äôs address the two approaches for using the API in your Supabase-powered app:
Option A ‚Äì Store Fixtures/Results in Supabase üì•
How it works: You would use API-Football to import and periodically update data (fixtures, scores, teams) into your own Supabase database. For example, at the start you might fetch all upcoming fixtures for the season and store them. Then, on a schedule (say daily or hourly), you fetch recent results or use the livescore endpoint to update scores/status in your DB. Feasibility: API-Football fully supports this approach. You can retrieve all fixtures in a league with a single query (or a few paginated queries) and load them into Supabase. The API even allows batch requests: you can query up to 20 fixture IDs in one call for efficiency‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. Historical matches can likewise be pulled in bulk. With data in your DB, your app will join user picks to those fixtures easily. Pros: Storing data will minimize API calls at runtime. Your app can read from Supabase (which is fast and free of rate limits) instead of calling the API for every user request. This is especially beneficial given the API call limits ‚Äì you fetch once, use often. It also gives you control: you can add custom fields (like a ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù or whether a fixture is open for picking) and ensure consistency for all users. Moreover, even if the API has a brief outage or you hit a rate limit, your app has the data it needs in Supabase. Cons: You‚Äôll need to implement data syncing. Schedules and scores change, so you must have cron jobs or backend logic to keep the Supabase data up to date (e.g., mark matches as finished and store the final score when they conclude). This adds complexity. Also, the initial load of data could use a chunk of your daily API calls (e.g., pulling an entire season of 380 fixtures might require multiple calls if done at once). However, since fixtures are known in advance, you can spread this out or use filtering (pull a month at a time, etc.). Trade-off: The storage approach is often preferred if you expect a lot of reads (because reading your own database is unlimited and fast) or need to join data (like checking all of a user‚Äôs picks against results). In fact, the API provider themselves hints at this best practice ‚Äì suggesting that you cache data in a database to ‚Äúavoid unnecessary updates‚Äù via repeat API calls‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. In other words, if a certain data (say a fixture‚Äôs details) is not going to change or is already fetched once, store it and reuse it rather than calling the API every time.
Option B ‚Äì Live Fetch On-Demand üåê
How it works: Your app would query API-Football in real time whenever it needs data. For example, when a user views the upcoming fixtures, your backend calls the API to get the latest fixtures; when they check results, you fetch the latest scores live. Feasibility: Thanks to flexible query parameters, this is also supported. You can fetch just what you need when you need it. For instance, you could fetch today‚Äôs fixtures (/fixtures?date=2025-04-10) or the current round‚Äôs fixtures, or a particular fixture by ID. Livescore could be fetched on demand when a user is looking at a live match. So technically, you can build the app without storing any match data persistently ‚Äì Supabase would then mainly store user-specific data (profiles, picks, etc.), and you‚Äôd reference fixture IDs and retrieve details live. Pros: The main advantage is simplicity and always-fresh data. You don‚Äôt have to write sync jobs or worry about stale data in your DB ‚Äì every time you call the API you get the latest info (scores, postponements, etc.). It also means less initial setup; you focus on displaying data rather than maintaining it. Option B might use less storage in your DB since you‚Äôre not saving large fixture lists (though fixture data isn‚Äôt very large in any case). Cons: The trade-off is heavier API usage and potential latency. Every user action that needs match data will count against your rate limit. For a handful of users this is fine, but if you have many users or if your UI makes frequent calls, you could hit the 100/day free limit quickly. For example, showing a list of 10 matches might be one API call (if you filter by round or date), which is fine. But if you show details for each match separately, that could be multiple calls. You have to design carefully to minimize calls (the API does allow filtering multiple fixtures in one request, as noted). Additionally, reliance on live fetching means if the API is slow or has an issue, your app might feel it (whereas with cached data, users would still see the last known info). There‚Äôs also a slight delay inherent in fetching from an external API vs. querying your own database. Hybrid Approach: These options aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. You could store some data and live-fetch other data. For instance, you might store all fixtures and basic info in Supabase (so you can list matches and join with picks easily), but not store the scores ‚Äì instead, fetch live scores when needed, or at least for live matches. Or store everything and just fetch live for the ongoing games to update them. The flexibility of API-Football allows either strategy.
Making the Choice
Option A (Store in Supabase) is generally recommended if you have a lot of relational logic (like users making picks on matches) because you can then use SQL joins or Supabase queries to combine user data with match data. It will significantly cut down on repetitive API calls ‚Äì for example, checking all users‚Äô picks against results can be done with one database query if you have results in the DB, whereas doing that via the API would require fetching each fixture‚Äôs result individually. Given the moderate rate limits on the free tier, caching data will help stay within limits. You‚Äôll need to implement update routines, but those can be scheduled (and 100 calls/day can actually go a long way if you, say, update 10 fixtures every 15 minutes). Option B (Live fetch only) can work well for a smaller-scale app or one that doesn‚Äôt need complex queries. If your usage is light (e.g., a small number of users checking once in a while), you might manage within 100 calls/day and get away without storing fixtures. Just be mindful that as soon as you have to show anything in bulk or do calculations, you might end up making many calls. In that case, moving to at least the Pro plan would be necessary to avoid hitting limits. Trade-offs Summary: Option A trades some development effort (for syncing) in order to gain speed and independence from API limits, whereas Option B trades more API calls for simpler implementation. Since API-Football supports all needed data (fixtures, teams, rounds, scores, etc.), either option is viable from a data standpoint ‚Äì it really comes down to scale and architecture preferences.
Conclusion ‚úÖ
In conclusion, API-Football can provide all the data needed for your football app. It supports fixtures with rich details (dates, times, teams, scores, statuses), results and outcomes, structured rounds/gameweeks, team info with logos, and both historical and live data for the Premier League and virtually any other major league. There are no significant data gaps for top-tier competitions ‚Äì you‚Äôll get complete coverage‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
. The main considerations are how you use the API (caching vs. on-demand) and aligning that with the provided rate limits and pricing tiers. With a free 100 calls/day (suitable for testing or low usage) and affordable paid plans for higher volumes‚Äã
API-FOOTBALL.COM
, you can choose an approach that fits your app‚Äôs needs. Bottom line: API-Football is robust enough to support Option A (storing fixtures/results in Supabase) by populating your database with all required data, and it also supports Option B (live queries) if you design around the call limits. Most likely, a combination will give the best of both worlds ‚Äì leveraging Supabase for efficient queries (especially for user picks and historical data) while using the API for real-time updates. With this API‚Äôs capabilities, your app should be well-equipped to handle users, profiles, competitions, rounds, picks, teams, and more ‚Äì all the building blocks are available. Just plan your usage to stay within the API‚Äôs limits, and you‚Äôll have a reliable feed of football data powering your application.
