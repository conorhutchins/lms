Supabase Implementation Overview
1. Packages and Setup
Your project uses the following Supabase packages:
@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs: For Next.js integration
@supabase/auth-helpers-react: For React hooks and components
@supabase/ssr: For server-side rendering support
@supabase/supabase-js: The core Supabase client
2. Client Configuration
Two client creators are set up:
Browser Client (src/lib/supabase/client.ts): Uses createClientComponentClient for client-side operations
Server Client (src/lib/supabase/server.ts): Uses createServerClient with cookie management for server-side operations
3. Authentication Flow
Middleware (middleware.ts): Handles session refresh on every request using Supabase's cookie-based auth
Auth Callback (pages/api/auth/callback.ts): Processes OAuth redirects and code exchange
Login Page (pages/login.tsx): Provides:
Email/password authentication via signInWithPassword
Google OAuth login via signInWithOAuth
Signup Page (pages/signup.tsx): Similar functionality to login page but for new users
4. Database Schema
Defined in lib/types/supabase.ts with several tables:
competitions: Competition information (fees, prize pot, etc.)
fixtures: Sports match data (teams, scores, gameweeks)
payments: User payment records
picks: User selections for teams in competitions
profiles: Basic user data
rounds: Competition rounds with deadlines
teams: Team information
5. Authentication Methods
OAuth (Google) with proper redirects and consent handling
Email/Password for traditional authentication
Session management with secure cookies
6. Security Features
Cookie-based session management
Proper use of environment variables for API keys
Server-side session validation
Secure cookie options (SameSite, secure flags in production)
The implementation follows modern best practices for Supabase integration with Next.js, using dedicated client configurations for both server and client-side rendering, and proper middleware for session management across all routes.
